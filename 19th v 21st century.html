The nineteenth century was a time of great upheavals, revolutions and transitions. It was also a time that yielded an astonishing output of 
literary treasures. It was the end of poetry’s millennia long reign as the prime literary form, and the hour of ascendancy of the novel. 
Perhaps fittingly then, the period yielded particularly fine examples of every genre, including both the novel and the poem. 
Of course, it was not the end of poetry; it was, rather, a repositioning and a new beginning. It was the birth of modern poetry and the 
birth of the novel as a genre that could hold its own as a literary form, as opposed to a frivolous medium of low-brow popular entertainment. 

In the world of the nineteenth century and before, poetry played an important social role – one which it no longer plays. 
And Science as we know it today had not yet developed. Together, these two conditions represent and crystallise the stark difference between 
the nineteenth century worldview and that of the 20th and 21st century. Theirs was a world in which science was new, unformed, and unfamiliar 
but poetry was old, and played an established and important part in the life of society. Today’s society is the opposite in many ways. 
Science and technology are part of the fabric of our everyday life, whereas poetry, at least in the traditional sense, is regarded as 
something peripheral that only a small minority are interested in.
