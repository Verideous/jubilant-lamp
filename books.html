<p>It goes through five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally
    and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends
    and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where
    she falls in love with her Byronic employer, <br/> Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family,
    during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St. John Rivers, proposes to her; and her reunion
    with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester. During these sections, the novel provides
    perspectives on a number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of
    the status quo (see the Themes section below). Literary critic Jerome Beaty opines that the close
    first person perspective leaves the reader "too uncritically accepting of her worldview"</p>
