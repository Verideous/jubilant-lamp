## Welcome to my website

It will develop organically, and I will be using my skills and interest in pretty much everything that interests me and that I'm learning about, including: coding, digital art, art in general, music, animation, video editing, literary criticism, creative writing, writing in general (blog, poetry, etc), etc, etc, etc (etc cubed).

It's pretty basic and unformed at this stage, and I'm not making any promises about it...I just felt inspired to do this because I'm always interested in hybrid, interdisciplinary things and I wanted to combine my interests and the skills/ knowledge I'm learning and create something. I was also kind of inspired by reading about Shelley Jackson's Patchwork Girl, though I haven't had the chance to look at the actual text yet. Just the idea excited me.
